# node-postgresql-boilerplate

# Intro
A base structure for backends that implement postgresql as database, here we use postgrespgpromises in order to connect with the db. Also you can use SEQUELIZE as orm

# Set DB

First of all, you need to run the SQL located in the path ./utils/db.sql

# Install and use

You only need to run 2 commands:
```sh
  $ npm install
  $ npm start
```

Enjoy it!
